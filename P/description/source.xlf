        <source>Welcome to the global OONI community! With this app you can collect evidence of Internet censorship and measure the speed and performance of your network.

        <source>OONI Probe includes free software tests, designed and developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI). We're a free software project under The Tor Project and we aim to increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world.</source>
      </trans-unit>
      <trans-unit id="intro3">
        <source>Since 2012, the global OONI community has collected millions of network measurements from more than 200 countries, shedding light on multiple cases of Internet censorship worldwide.</source>
      </trans-unit>
      <trans-unit id="intro4">
        <source>By running OONI Probe, you can examine the blocking of websites, measure the speed and performance of your network, and search for middleboxes. We're integrating more OONI Probe tests into this app on an ongoing basis, so stay tuned!</source>

        <source>OONI's Web Connectivity test is designed to measure whether sites are blocked by means of DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. By running this test, you will collect data that can serve as evidence of Internet censorship, and you will also receive relevant circumvention tips.</source>

        <source>OONI's implementation of the Network Diagnostic Test (NDT) measures the speed and performance of your network, while the DASH test measures video streaming performance. Both tests can potentially be useful for examining cases of throttling and other net neutrality violations.</source>

        <source>We publish all network measurement data that we collect because open data allows third parties to conduct independent studies, verify OONI findings and explore other research questions. Such data also helps increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world. All data is published on OONI Explorer (https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/) and on our API (https://api.ooni.io/).</source>
