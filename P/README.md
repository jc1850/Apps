OONI Probe is free and open source software designed to measure internet
censorship and other forms of network interference.

Other supported platforms: [iOS](https://github.com/ooni/probe-ios),
[Desktop](https://github.com/ooni/probe-desktop), [CLI](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli)

## Developer information

This application requires Android Studio. We use Gradle and, as part of the
initial gradle sync, Android studio will download all the required
dependencies.

The most important dependency is `oonimkall`. This dependency contains
the network measurement engine. Its sources are at
[ooni/probe-cli](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli).

When using Gradle from the command line, you will need to set the
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable to point to the directory in
which you have installed the Android SDK.

## Build variants

We use the classic `debug` and `release` build types. We also
implement the following flavours:

- `stable`, `dev`, and `experimental` (dimension: `testing`);

- `full` and `fdroid` (dimension: `license`).

The `testing` dimension controls whether we're building a release
or a more unstable version. We build releases using the `stable`
flavour. The `dev` flavour builds the version of the app that should
be released on the store as the beta channel. The `experimental`
flavour, instead, allows a developer to build a one-off version of
the app that uses a custom build of the `oonimkall` library.

For `stable` and `dev`, we fetch `oonimkall` from the
[Maven central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.ooni/oonimkall)
repository. The `experimental` flavour, instead, requires you to
put the `oonimkall.aar` you built inside `engine-experimental`.

The `license` dimension controls which proprietary libraries to include
into the build. The `full` flavour includes all such dependencies,
while the `fdroid` flavour does not include any of them.

The variant names are therefore:

- `experimentalFullDebug`
- `experimentalFullRelease`
- `devFullDebug`
- `devFullRelease`
- `stableFullDebug`
- `stableFullRelease`

We additionally have `stableFdroidDebug` and `stableFdroidRelease`.

All of this is controlled by [app/build.gradle](app/build.gradle).

## Gradle modules

- [app](app) contains the mobile app;
- [engine](engine) contains wrappers for `oonimkall`, the
measurement engine library;
- [engine-experimental](engine-experimental) allows us
to implement the `experimental` build flavour where you
put the `oonimkall.aar` file you built inside `engine-experimental`
rather than downloading it from Maven Central.

## Building an apk

Ensure you have Android Studio and Android SDK installed. Build the `devFullRelease`
variant using Android Studio or this command line:

```
./gradlew assembleDevFullRelease
```

## Building the app for f-droid

Instead to build the app to stay compliant to F-Droid use `fdroid`, which
contains small tweaks required to have the app accepted by [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/).

```
./gradlew assembleFdroid
```

## Testing

Run unit tests 

```
./gradlew testStableFullDebug
```

Run instrumented tests

_Note: To also run the automation tests (to generate screenshots), set the Build Config flag 
`RUN_AUTOMATION` as true._

```
./gradlew connectedStableFullDebugAndroidTest
```

Generate code coverage report (after all unit and instrumented tests successfully passed)

```
./gradlew jacocoAndroidTestReport
```
